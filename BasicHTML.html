<!--When you start making website you need to know some basics in HTML. 
HTML is not a coding language, but a structual code for the foundation of your website. 
You can think HTML like this: HTML is the skeleton of your website, CSS is the apperance (like eyecolor, headshape etc.)
and javascript is the nerves, muscles and other functional stuff.
Now, here I want to provide the basic stuff of HTML tags, attributes and other cool stuff. I will also provide a more advanced version-->

<!--To start of we need this big thing: -->
<html lang="en">                                                            <!--The language of the website-->
<head>                                                                      <!--Header tag is all of your header stuff, like linking to style.css, and js scripts.-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">                                                  <!--UFT-8 Makes it possible to use emojis-->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  <!--Sets up the viewport (THE ACTUAL WEBSITE)-->
    <title>Document</title>                                                 <!--The name of your website-->
</head>
<body>                                                                      <!--In body goes all of your content that is visible to the user-->
    
</body>
</html>

<!--To comment something you just have to wrap your comment inside like this--> <!--[YOUR TEXT]-->

<!--In body we can start adding some content like buttons, paragraphs and divs (Just remember that all tags start with <[tagname]> and end with </[tagname]>)-->

<p>This is a paragraph!</p>         <!--Makes a paragraph (JUST NORMAL TEXT)-->
<button>This is a button</button>   <!--Makes a button-->
<div>This is a div</div>            <!--Makes a div which you can use for a lot, but it's often used to wrap content in a section-->
<a href="#"></a>                    <!--Makes a link that you can guide the user to. (Where there is a "#" you have to delete the "#" and replace it with your link!)-->
<span>This is a span section</span> <!--Make a span, which can be used for sections-->

<!--The numbers define the size of the text, h1 is the biggest and h6 is the smallest-->
<h1>Heading 1</h1>                  <!--<h1></h1> Makes a heading (34 px)-->
<h2>Heading 2</h2>                  <!--<h2></h2> Makes a heading (30 px)-->
<h3>Heading 3</h3>                  <!--<h3></h3> Makes a heading (24 px)-->
<h4>Heading 4</h4>                  <!--<h4></h4> Makes a heading (20 px)-->
<h5>Heading 5</h5>                  <!--<h5></h5> Makes a heading (18 px)-->
<h6>Heading 6</h6>                  <!--<h6></h6> Makes a heading (16 px)-->

<!--The Img tags is a bit different. It does not have a closing tag. It has a lot of styling for the image (alt, width, height)-->
